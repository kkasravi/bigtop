Description: A high-throughput distributed messaging system.
 Kafka is designed for persistent messages as the common case.
 Throughput rather than features are the primary design constraint.
 State about what has been consumed is maintained as part of the consumer not the server.
 Kafka is explicitly distributed. It is assumed that producers, brokers, and consumers are all spread over multiple machines.
